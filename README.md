# Daily Data Analytics — May 2025

Every day in May, I set aside 50 minutes to explore an idea through data.  
What emerged was a mosaic of questions, patterns, and small discoveries — from transport data and climate change to game mechanics and economic trends.

This repository contains all 31 analyses, each in its own folder, with code, data, and visualisation.  
Each entry reflects my philosophy as *The Accidental Scientist*: a daily practice of curiosity, rigour, and exploration — one accident at a time.

If you're interested in the thinking behind the numbers — not just the conclusions — I invite you to explore the notebooks.  
This was never about being perfect. It was about showing up, every day, and seeing what emerged.
